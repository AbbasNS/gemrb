Description: This table lists resource data for area projectiles. The original engine had these hardcoded in the .exe

Columns -
   RESOURCE1 - A BAM resref which is drawn in the entire area of effect.
   RESOURCE2 - A VVC (or BAM) resref which is drawn in the center of effect once.
   RESOURCE3 - (currently unused)
   FLAGS     - a bitfield which alters the way the resources are drawn

Values for the FLAGS bitfield -
   1 - RESOURCE1 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
   2 - fills the entire area of effect randomly, otherwise it is a (spreading) circle
   4 - no spreading, the filler graphics is already at its destination, otherwise it starts from the center
   8 - RESOURCE2 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
