Description: This table implements spell resistances based on a simple condition of the target's stats.
One row defines a certain 'semi-hardcoded' condition. For iwd/iwd2 these conditions were hardcoded into the engine.

Columns - 
STAT      - the name or number of the stat
VALUE     - a value which has to match the stat
RELATION  - a symbol for the comparation to be performed
COMMENT   - unused by GemRB, it is just a reminder

Rows - spell immunity conditions

Stats over 255 (0x100 and above) are not real stats, but either virtual stats, or
composite conditions.

0x100   - caster is source of the spell (spell effect won't affect self)
0x101   - caster isn't source of the spell (spell effect won't affect others)
0x102   - the personal space of the target, set in avatars.2da  (SPACE column)
0x103   - both rows are true (the two fields designate 2 other rows in this file)
0x104   - neither rows are true (similar to 0x103)
0x105   - only the lowest 2 bits of alignment are calculated
0x106   - area flags (outdoor, forest, etc)
0x107   - daytime flag
0x108   - caster and target EA relation (using the EA fields to calculate this)
