Description: This table implements spell resistances based on a simple condition of the target's stats.
One row defines a certain 'semi-hardcoded' condition. For iwd/iwd2 these conditions were hardcoded into the engine.

Columns - 
STAT      - the name or number of the stat
VALUE     - a value which has to match the stat
RELATION  - a symbol for the comparation to be performed
COMMENT   - unused by GemRB, it is just a reminder

Rows - spell immunity conditions
