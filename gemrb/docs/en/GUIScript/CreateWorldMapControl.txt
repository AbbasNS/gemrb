Prototype: GemRB.CreateWorldMapControl(WindowIndex, ControlID, x, y, w, h, flags)

Description: This command will create a special WorldMapControl, which is currently unavailable via .chu files. If WindowIndex and ControlID (not ControlIndex!) point to a valid control, it will replace that control with the WorldMapControl using the original control's dimensions (x,y,w,h are ignored). 

Parameters:
WindowIndex - the value returned from LoadWindow
ControlID   - the new control will be available via this controlID
x,y,w,h     - X position, Y position, Width and Height of the control
flags       - 0 - don't change cursor when it is hovering over an area
              1 - change cursor when it is hovering over an area

Return value: N/A

Example: 
        Window = GemRB.LoadWindow (0)
        GemRB.CreateWorldMapControl (Window, 4, 0, 62, 640, 418, Travel)
        WorldMapControl = GemRB.GetControl (Window, 4)
