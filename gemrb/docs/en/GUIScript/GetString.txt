Prototype: GemRB.GetString(Strref)

Description: Returns string for given strref. Usually, you don't need to resolve a string before use, you can use SetText with an strref parameter. This command lets you alter the string. For example, if you want to add a level value, you'll need this.

Parameters: Strref - a string index from the dialog.tlk table.

Return value: A string with resolved tokens. To resolve %d's, you must either use StatComment, or do it manually.

Example: GemRB.SetText (Window, Label, GemRB.GetString(12137)+str(level+1) )
The above example will display "Level: <LEVEL>" in the addressed label.
