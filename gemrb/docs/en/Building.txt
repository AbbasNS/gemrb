BUILDING GEMRB FROM CVS SOURCES ON UNIX
---------------------------------------

Tools you will need to build GemRB from CVS:

  - libtool
  - automake
  - autoconf

  - GNU make
  - C++ (g++)

Libraries:

  - ZLib
  - Python 2.3 or better, compiled with shared libraries (*)
  - SDL 1.2
  - OpenAL


(*) On some systems it means you have to build and install Python manually.
    Specify --enable-shared option when running Python's configure.



Building GemRB the easy way:
----------------------------

Following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install

By default, GemRB is installed into directory $HOME/GemRB/ . Supporting
files are mostly installed into the same directory.

If you want to install GemRB into system-wide dir, or if you prefer
installation into bin/, lib/, man/ ... subdirs under installation directory,
either edit autogen.sh or run the tools by hand (see following paragraphs).


Running all the tools by hand:
------------------------------

  libtoolize
  aclocal
  autoheader
  automake --add-missing
  autoconf


To install GemRB into the same directory hierarchy as with autogen.sh, 
use command similar to the one below:

  TGT=$HOME/GemRB/
  ./configure --prefix=$TGT --bindir=$TGT --sysconfdir=$TGT --datadir=$TGT --libdir=$TGT/plugins/ --disable-subdirs

If you on the other hand want to install GemRB into standard directory 
structure, run `configure' this way instead:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/GemRB/


  make
  make install
