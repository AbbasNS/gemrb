BUILDING GEMRB FROM GIT SOURCES ON UNIX
---------------------------------------


Tools you will need to build GemRB from GIT:
  - git

  - libtool
  - automake
  - autoconf

  - GNU make
  - C++ (g++)

Libraries:

  - ZLib
  - Python 2.3 or better, compiled with shared libraries (*)
  - SDL 1.2
  - OpenAL
  - libpng

(*) On some systems it means you have to build and install Python manually.
    Specify --enable-shared option when running Python's configure.


Building GemRB the easy way:
----------------------------

The following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.

  ./autogen.sh
  make
  make install

By default, GemRB is installed into the directory $HOME/GemRB/ . Supporting
files are mostly installed into the same directory.

If you want to install GemRB into a system-wide dir, run autogen.sh with the
target prefix as an argument. If you prefer the installation into bin/, lib/,
man/ ... subdirs under the installation directory, either edit autogen.sh 
(remove the --disable-subdirs flag) or run the tools by hand (see below).


Running all the tools by hand:
------------------------------

  libtoolize
  aclocal
  autoconf
  autoheader
  automake --add-missing


To install GemRB into the same directory hierarchy as with autogen.sh, 
use a command similar to the one below:

  TGT=$HOME/GemRB/
  ./configure --prefix=$TGT --bindir=$TGT --sysconfdir=$TGT --datadir=$TGT --libdir=$TGT/plugins/ --disable-subdirs

If you on the other hand want to install GemRB into a standard directory
structure, run `configure' this way instead:

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/GemRB/

If the configuring went ok, you can finally run:

  make
  make install
