BUILDING GEMRB WITH CMAKE FROM GIT SOURCES
------------------------------------------

Tools you will need to build GemRB from GIT:
  - git
  - cmake
  - make
  - g++

Libraries:
  - ZLib
  - Python 2.3 or better, compiled with shared libraries
  - SDL 1.2
  - OpenAL
  - libpng

Building GemRB on unix-like systems
-----------------------------------

The following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install

By default, GemRB is installed into /usr/local ("fhs"). You can pass -DLAYOUT
with "home" or "opt" to change the general layout and -DPREFIX to change the
install path prefix.
Pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake if you want to create a debug build.

Building GemRB with mingw
-------------------------

The following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "MinGW MakeFiles"
  mingw32-make
  mingw32-make install

By default, GemRB is installed into c:\Program Files\GemRB . Supporting
files are mostly installed into the same directory.
