Tools you will need to build GemRB from SVN:

Building GemRB
----------------------------

The following commands will try to configure, make and install GemRB.
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -G "MinGW MakeFiles"
  mingw32-make
  mingw32-make install

By default, GemRB is installed into c:\Program Files\GemRB . Supporting
files are mostly installed into the same directory.
