Following is a list of cheats you can use during development of GemRB.
If you implement a new cheatkey, try to assign the same key as in the
original engine (if you implement a similar function).
This list can be incomplete and obsolete - for current status, look into
gemrb/plugins/Core/GameControl.cpp, functions GameControl::OnKeyRelease() 
and GameControl::Draw().

Cheat keys are disabled by default. To activate them, either type command
GemRB.EnableCheatKeys(1) on console (pop-up with ESC key), or put it into
some GUIScript - e.g. for PS:T in Start.py.

GameControl control must be focused for the keys to be recognized, so it
might be needed to 'click' the GameControl (i.e. map) first.


Ctrl-A - Alters the animation ID of the actor. You have to hover your
         mouse over it.

Ctrl-B - Inserts/Removes spell effect S056ICBL on selected actor. 
         Exactly one actor must be selected.

Ctrl-D - Trap or trapped container pointed w/ mouse is disarmed.

Ctrl-J - Teleports (jumps) selected actors to current mouse position.

Ctrl-M - Prints (on terminal or DOS window) useful info on pointed actor, door
         container or infopoint and current map

Ctrl-O - Marks current mouse position as start point (origin) for path drawn
         with Ctrl-P

Ctrl-P - Draws path from start point marked by Ctrl-O to current mouse 
         position.

Ctrl-S - Alters the stance (animation state) of the actor. You have to
         hover your mouse over it.

Ctrl-T - Advances time by one hour.

Ctrl-X - Prints (on terminal or DOS window) name of current area script
         and current mouse position converted to game coordinates.

Ctrl-Y - Kills pointed actor

Ctrl-Z - Swaps original (not personalized) and current palettes on 
         pointed actor. Also prints some color-related info on the actor.

Ctrl-4 - Toggles debug flag DEBUG_SHOW_INFOPOINTS (show all
         traps and infopoints)

Ctrl-5 - Toggles debug flag DEBUG_SHOW_SEARCHMAP (show the searchmap)

Ctrl-6 - Toggles debug flag DEBUG_SHOW_PALETTES (show original and current
         palettes for pointed actor)

Ctrl-7 - Toggle drawing of Fog-Of-War (actually explored bitmap atm.)
         in GameControl.

ALT    - Toggles debug flag DEBUG_SHOW_CONTAINERS (show all containers
          and doors)

TAB    - Sets debug flag DEBUG_XXX while pressed (unused)
