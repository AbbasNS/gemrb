How to make a release
*********************

Preparing and testing CVS
=========================

* Make sure that version numbers in 
    configure.in
    gemrb/include/globals.h 
  are correct for the upcoming version.

* Update NEWS with highlights since the last release 

* Update ChangeLog with entry about release

* Make sure that GemRB CVS is in compilable and runnable state

  - download a clean CVS tree and test it.

  - Make distribution .tar.gz  (make dist) and test it as well -
    especially make sure all needed files are included.

* Tag current CVS to version number e.g. GEMRB_0_2_3
  i.e. in the gemrb root directory do
    cvs tag GEMRB_0_2_3

* Update from CVS to the tagged version
