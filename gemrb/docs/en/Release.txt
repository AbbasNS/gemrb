How to make a release
*********************

* Make sure that version number in configure.in is correct
  for the upcoming version. For the time being, set various version
  numbers in gemrb/include/globals.h as well.

* Update ChangeLog with highlights since the last release 

* Make sure that GemRB CVS is in compilable and running state
  i.e. download a clean CVS tree and test it.

  Make distribution .tar.gz  (make dist) and test it as well -
  - especially make sure all needed files are included.

* Tag current CVS to version number e.g. GEMRB_0_2_3

* Update from CVS to the tagged version

* on Unix/Linux: 
  ./autogen.sh
  make dist

* To be defined: Windows binary 

* Put the tarballs/binaries into Releases on SF

* Announce on homepage & SF

* Possibly announce on Freshmeat/Happypenguin
