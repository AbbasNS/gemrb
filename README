Introduction
------------
GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a portable open-source
reimplementation of the Infinity Engine that underpinned Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. It sports a cleaner design, greater
extensibility and several innovations.
Would you like to create a game like Baldur's Gate?

To try it out you either need some of the ORIGINAL game's data or you can
get a tiny sneak peek by running the included trivial game demo.

The original game data has to be installed on a windows
partition and mounted or copied to your (Linux/Unix) filesystem, installed
with WINE or extracted manually from the CDs using the tool `unshield'.

What little documentation exists is mostly in gemrb/docs/en/ and
subdirectories, the gemrb.6 man page, this file and the website.

Supported platforms
-------------------
Supported (i.e. we got reports about successfully running GemRB) systems:
Linux x86, x86-64, ppc
FreeBSD x86
MS Windows
various Macintosh systems (even pre x86) also should work ...
some smart phones (Symbian, Android, other Linux-based, iOS)
some consoles (OpenPandora, Dingoo)
some exotic OSes (ReactOS, SyllableOS, Haiku, AmigaOS)

g++ 4.3 is known to miscompile gemrb.
