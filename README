GemRB (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a "port"
(actually new implementation) of the original Infinity Engine (the one
of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, etc...) to
Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows with some enhancements. Do you like
creating a game like Baldur's Gate?

It means that you either need some of the original games data
somewhere on your harddisk, or you can try to use data from
Dragonlance Total Conversion project - see link below.

The original games data have to be either installed on windows
partition and mounted to your Linux/Unix filesystem, installed on
windows and then copied to your filesystem, or extracted manually from
the CDs using tool `unshield'.


What little is there of documentation is mostly in gemrb/docs/en/ and
subdirectories, gemrb.1 man page and this file.

Supported (i.e. semi-working) systems:

Linux x86
FreeBSD x86
MS Windows
Linux amd64 ? - used to work ...


Requirements:

SDL 1.2
OpenAL
Python 2.3 or above, with shared libs
ZLib
