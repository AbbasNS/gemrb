GemRB (Game Engine with preRendered Background) is a port of the
original Infinity Engine (the one of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale,
Planescape: Torment, etc...) to Linux/Unix, MacOs X and Windows with
some enhancements. Do you like creating a game like Baldur's Gate?

What little is there of documentation is mostly in gemrb/docs/en/ and
subdirectories, gemrb.1 man page and this file.

Supported (i.e. semi-working) systems:

Linux x86
FreeBSD x86
MS Windows
Linux amd64 ? - used to work ...
