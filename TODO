Scripts:
1. Run All creature scripts when the creatures are 'activated'.
Creatures are activated if they are:
 a. in visibility range of a player (or object that was marked as a clear fog of war).
 b. affected by the 'aifast' flag (which effectively disables deactivation).

2. Run All area scripts not just the active areas.
Area scripts are queued, master areas get on the head of the queue, non-master areas get in the tail of the queue. See also: SetMasterArea action/mastarea.2da

3. Fix script compiler to group string parameters depending on opcode

Known Bugs:
1. problem: Dialog options that are disabled by the trigger condition are still accessible via hotkey.
   solution: The options should be marked at evaluation time
