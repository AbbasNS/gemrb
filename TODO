Scripts:
1. Run All creature scripts when the creatures are 'activated'.
Creatures are activated if they are:
 a. in visibility range of a player (or object that was marked as a clear fog of war).
 b. affected by the 'aifast' flag (which effectively disables deactivation).

2. Run All area scripts not just the active areas.
Area scripts are queued, master areas get on the head of the queue, non-master areas get in the tail of the queue. See also: SetMasterArea action/mastarea.2da

3. (DONE) Fix script compiler to group string parameters depending on opcode

4. TLK tags (easy to implement)

Items:
1. (DONE) Loading containers/items in areas
2. Dropping of items (first create an opcode)
3. Picking up an item (create opcode)
4. Equipping items

Effects:
1. Create base system for effect blocks
2. Implement effects

Area:
1. Implement cover (wallgroups)
2. Fog of war

Known Bugs:
1. problem: Dialog options that are disabled by the trigger condition are still accessible via hotkey. (FIXED)

2. problem: reloading of an area doesn't check if it was already loaded, thus eating memory (FIXED)

3. problem: actors who have joined are still loaded by the area (duplicated). (FIXED)

4. problem: sound isn't working in movies (FIXED)
