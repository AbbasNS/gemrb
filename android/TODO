- prep_env.sh should have more error checks
- add a dialog on first run to prompt for GamePath
- version checks for override, unhardcoded and GUIScripts
- mouse cursor seems to get positioned at the corners of the screen touches for some reason, most likely not directly related to the android build though
- touches have to be rather quick to register as click events, might be related to SDL20Driver::ProcessFirstTouch()
