\- emulator for Infinity Engine-based games

.\"###################################################
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gemrb
[-c config-file]
.br
.B torment
.br

.\"###################################################
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gemrb
is an emulator for Infinity Engine-based games, fine RPGs like Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale or Planescape: Torment. 

.I gemrb
is only an engine; to actually play anything you have to have 
data from the original games installed where they can be found by 
.IR gemrb .

.\"###################################################
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
.I FILE
.br
use other configuration file than default
.IR gemrb.cfg .  

.B Note:
You can also use program's name as a mean to select the configuration file.
For example, if the program's name is 
.I torment 
instead of
.IR gemrb ,
the engine first seaches for 
.I torment.cfg 
and only if it's not found it searches for 
.IR gemrb.cfg .

To use this feature, just create a symbolic link
.I torment
pointing to
.I gemrb
binary and run
.IR torment .

.\"###################################################
.SH Configuration File
.PD 0
Configuration file consists of pairs
.IR PARAMETER=VALUE ,
each on its own line. The case of PARAMETER is not significant, 
GameType is the same as GAMETYPE. If the same PARAMETER is defined 
more than once, only the last occurence is used.

Empty lines and lines starting with `#' (hash sign) are ignored.

.B Parameters:

.TP
.BR GameType =(bg1|bg2|tob|iwd|iwd2|how|pst)
Type of the game. The value is a name of subdirectory in override/ 
and GUIScripts/ directories
with game type-specific files and scripts. It is at present also used
for various tweaks hardcoded in GemRB engine.

.TP
.BR GameName =STRING
Name of the game, as it appears in the window title-bar.

.TP
.BR GamePath =PATH
Path to directory where the original game is installed. If you can't
install the game under MS Windows, you can try to unpack the data files
with 
.I unshield
program found at 
.IR http://synce.sourceforge.net .

.TP
.BR CD1 =PATH
.TP
.BR CD2 =PATH
.TP
.BR CDn =....
Path to data files from game's particular CDs.

.\".TP
.\".BR INIConfig =FILE
.\"Name of the game's INI file, relative to 
.\".IR GamePath .
.\"E.g. for Baldur's Gate game it is baldur.ini.


.TP
.BR Width =INT
Game window width (in pixels).

.TP
.BR Height =INT
Game window height (in pixels).

.TP
.BR Bpp =INT
Color depth of game window, (in bits per pixel).

.TP
.BR Fullscreen =(0|1)
Whether the game should run in fullscreen mode. Note that fullcreen mode is
currently buggy.

.\".TP
.\".BR ForceStereo =(0|1)
.\"Some older games such as BG1 and PST need this parameter to be 
.\".IR 1 .
.\"For other game types set it to
.\".IR 0 .

.TP
.BR TooltipDelay =INT
Delay (in ms) before tooltips are displayed when mouse is not moving.
Reasonable number for this option is e.g.
.IR 500 .

.TP
.BR VolumeAmbients =INT
Volume of ambient sounds, in percents. Default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeMovie =INT
Volume during movie playback, in percents. Default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeMusic =INT
Volume of background music, in percents. Default is

.TP
.BR VolumeSFX =INT
Volume of sound effects, in percents. Default is
.IR 100 .

.TP
.BR VolumeVoices =INT
Volume of PC or NPC voices, in percents. Default is
.IR 100 .


.TP
.BR SkipIntroVideos =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
the intro and logo videos are skipped to save developer's nerves. Default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR DrawFPS =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
current FPS (Frames per Second) value is drawn in top left window corner. Default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR FogOfWar =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
unexplored parts of an area are blacked out. Since the unexplored bitmap is
not updated by actors yet, it's set to
.I 0 
by default.

.TP
.BR EnableCheatKeys =(0|1)
This parameter is meant for developers. If set to
.IR 1 ,
certain keys allow you to inspect internal state of objects, do forbidden things, etc. The keys are listed in 
.I CheatKeys.txt
file. Do NOT use this option unless you want to make your hands dirty :-). Default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR ScriptDebugMode =(n)
This parameter is meant for developers. It is a combination of bit values

.IR 1
- count references,

.IR 2
- display cutscene warnings,

.IR 4
- display variable warnings,

.IR 8
- display action warnings,

.IR 16
- display trigger warnings.

Default is
.IR 0 .

.TP
.BR CaseSensitive =(0|1)
When 
this parameter is set to 
.IR 1 ,
the engine will try to find files regardless of their names' case at the cost
of a slight speed penalty. This is especially important when using
game files on CD-ROMs, where the files can't be renamed. Like 
many Windows programs, the original games use inconsistent mix
of lower/upper case letters for naming and referencing their files. 

Set this parameter to 
.I 1
on Unix-like systems.

.TP
.BR SaveAsOriginal =(0|1)
Set this parameter to
.IR 1 ,
if you want to keep the save game compatible with the original engine.

.TP
.BR CachePath =PATH
User-writable directory where the engine caches uncompressed and temporary
files.

.TP
.BR GemRBPath =PATH
Path to GemRB installation. Soon to be obsoleted.

.TP
.BR GUIScriptsPath =PATH
Path to directory with scripts controlling game's GUI. 

.TP
.BR SavePath =PATH
Path to directory with save games. Note that this directory has to
contain 
.I save/
and/or eventually
.I mpsave/
subdirectories and only these subdirectories contain the actual
saved games.

.I SavePath
defaults to
.IR GamePath .

.TP
.BR GameOnCD =(0|1)


.TP
.BR GameDataPath =PATH
Path to original game's installed data files, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's 
.IR data .
???

.TP
.BR GameOverridePath =PATH
Path to original game's override dir, relative to GamePath.
Usually it's 
.IR override .
Original games use this directory to place last-minute patches.
